#   Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
#   line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
#   Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.

# ! Attention: the lines starting with "baseurl" and "url" are edited on travis build with a search and replace regex
# Any Change in those two lines should be checked with the "cibuild" script
